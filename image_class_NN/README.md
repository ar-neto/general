# Image classification neural network

This folder contains neural networks models for image classification. These models were made from with the tensorflow library and corresponding dependencies. Moreover, other python librarios were employes such as Matplot lib and numpy. THe code is placed in a .ipynb format as it facilitates demonstation.

The NN_cifar10 file was a network trained with the cifar10 model using a linear network. Here, an accuracy of 56.87% was obtained.
