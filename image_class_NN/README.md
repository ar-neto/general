# Image classification neural network

This folder contains neural networks models for image classification. These models were made from with the tensorflow library and corresponding dependencies. Moreover, other python librarios were employes such as Matplot lib and numpy. THe code is placed in a .ipynb format as it facilitates demonstation.

The NN_cifar10 file was a network trained usinga linear network with the cifar10 image dataset. This tateset contains thounsands of images of 10 different categories ('Plane', 'Car', 'Bird', 'Cat','Deer','Dog', 'Frog', 'Horse', 'Ship' and 'Truck') Here, an accuracy of 56.87% was obtained.
