# Image Detection Neural Networks

This project was done as a way to use image detection neural networks in images collected from a computer webcam. The neural networks implementation was done using Tensorflow and Google Colab computaional resources. This project has the advantege that the model implementetion is modular, meaning that different models can be easily implemented. One exapmple of this project wneh utilising the  Inception Resnet V2 model (https://tfhub.dev/google/faster_rcnn/openimages_v4/inception_resnet_v2/1).

## Dependencies

As this notebook is meant to be ran on Google Colab, all the necessary packages are already pre-installed. Moreoer, it should be mentioned that the execution was done with the COlab's hardware accelerators
