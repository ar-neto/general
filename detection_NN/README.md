# Image Detection Neural Networks

This project was done as a way to use image detection neural networks in images collected from a computer webcam. The neural networks implementation was done using Tensorflow and Google Colab computaional resources.


## Dependencies

As this notebook is meant to be ran on Google Colab, all the necessary packages are already pre-installed. Moreoer, it should be mentioned that the execution was done with the COlab's hardware accelerators
