##Sodium acetate Simulation##

Sodium acetate is acompound with a variety of usas, ranging from beign a food additive to a hand warmer. In 2016, its market size was estimated to be over USD 120 million (https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/sodium-acetate-market), and it still expects growth. In order to tap into said growth, one would have to build a production plant.
For that end, I bring you this simulation - made using the DWSIM simulation software.
